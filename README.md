# MyVSCodeTest
Just testing pushing a .Net Core 1.1 web app with Visual Studio 2015, to GiHub, so I can test cloning it etc. in Visual Studio Code in Ubuntu and so on.  I want to become comfortable with it, and highlight and investigate any problems before proceeding to a project.

I'm not at a point where I want to readily share my self-hosted blog yet - it still needs articles completing, and then some refactoring and tidying-up. It might go down occasionally too while I finish my reverse proxy set-up.  But what the heck, I'll link to it here anyway:
